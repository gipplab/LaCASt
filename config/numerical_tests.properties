# Define the numerical values you want to test in a list in Maple's 2D input format.
# Note that, if a formula contain multiple variables, such as 'x' and 'y' than the numerical tests

# then the algorithm will test the values: x=1,y=1; x=2,y=1; x=1,y=2; x=2,y=2;
# As an example for 8 values on the unit circle:
# numerical_values=[1, sqrt(2)+sqrt(2)*I, I, sqrt(2)-sqrt(2)*I, -1, -sqrt(2)-sqrt(2)*I, -I, -sqrt(2)+sqrt(2)*I]
