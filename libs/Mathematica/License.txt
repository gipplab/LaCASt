("Licensee"), free of charge, a non-exclusive, perpetual license to use, 
copy, and distribute J/Link ("the Program") for the purpose of enhancing 
the Mathematica interoperability of certain Licensee products and services 
("Licensee Work"), provided that such use or distribution does not violate 
the terms of this Agreement. 

1. Program Use
Licensee can download, install and use the Program. Licensee is permitted 
to distribute the Program for noncommercial purposes, provided that this 
Agreement is included with each such copy distributed. Any person or entity 
who obtains or uses a copy of the Program under or through this Agreement 
agrees to be bound thereby. 

2. Ownership
The Program and related user documentation are proprietary products of WRI, 
and are protected under U.S. copyright law. All right, title, and interest 
in and to the Program , including associated intellectual property rights,

translate the Program. Licensee may not use, copy, modify, or distribute

PARTY.  

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of

is expressly excluded.

6.  Waiver, Severability, and Merger 
The failure of either party to enforce any rights granted hereunder or to 
take action against the other party in the event of any breach hereunder 
shall not be deemed a waiver by that party as to subsequent enforcement of 
rights or subsequent actions in the event of future breaches. If any part 
of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the 
validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and 
enforceable according to its terms. This Agreement is the full and final 
expression of the intent of the parties with respect to the subject matter 
herein; this Agreement supersedes any prior or contemporaneous discussions,
